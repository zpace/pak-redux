The following was taken from the installation instructions for Steve Crawford's Bench Spectrograph Simulator (2008-ish):

1. It is suggested that this simulator is run with java "1.4.1_01" or better
2. Save [bsgclass.jar] to your computer. This can be done by right-clicking on the file name and choosing "Save As..." or a similar option
3. Unpack the file by using the command `jar xvf bsgclass.jar` (typo in original)
4. Run the simulator with the command `java BenchSetupApp`
